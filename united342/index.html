=========================== 
Good day dear United, how are you? 

Your decades long client is here. Yesterday United canceled my flight for today because there was no aircraft to send from LGA to DEN. After all my flight was chosen, I had to pay for overlay accommodations / expenses in NYC is there a chance that this could be reimbursed?... totaling $297 USD

and/or at least would you be so kind to provide me with a customer appreciation courtesy to give me one free checked bag for this flight please? 

and/or a $35 refund / credit would be the same;

yes delay was due to weather, but other flights are going and landing in Denver today, but MY flight was chosen and canceled with no option for me to fly today 

this is a matter of principal - you may find more info on this matter and case at https://nyc5009.github.io/united342

Thank you so much
awaiting 
- Andrei Choulga
